### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I study Mechatronics/Robotics at Tomsk Polytechnic University and absolutely love it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mecanum wheeled robot. Specifically on the lower level (motor control with STM32)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning control theory and C-programming of MCUs

I've been interested in custom keyboars for a couple of years, so some MK projects are highly possible.
